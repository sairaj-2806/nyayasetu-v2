But I DO expect every single one of us to understand our project so well that any of you could stand up, explain what we built, demonstrate the live website, and answer questions with complete confidence. By the time we leave this room today, nobody will be confused. We are going to walk through the problem, the solution, the website, the tech stack, and the exact questions judges will throw at us.

addParagraph("Practice these high-frequency evaluation questions:");

addBullet(
  "Q1: Why did you not use an LLM to schedule cases directly?",
  "Answer: 'In court administration, hallucinations are disastrous. An LLM might book two trials in the same room. We use deterministic mathematical constraint programming for 100% certainty, restricting LLMs to natural language Q&A.'",
);
addBullet(
  "Q2: How do you handle advocate schedule clashes across courtrooms?",
  "Answer: 'Our engine tracks advocate representation registry-wide. Hard Constraint #3 checks whether an advocate is booked in another courtroom; if so, that slot is disqualified.'",
);
addBullet(
  "Q3: Does your system comply with judicial ethics and AI guidelines?",
  "Answer: 'Yes. We strictly adhere to Supreme Court Draft Regulation 9. The algorithm never auto-commits hearings; human registrars and judges retain full authority.'",
);
addBullet(
  "Q4: How does this integrate with the existing eCourts CIS system?",
  "Answer: 'NyayaSetu is designed as an intelligent operational brain for eCourts. It ingests CNR numbers from CIS via API, optimizes schedules, and posts cause lists back to CIS.'",
